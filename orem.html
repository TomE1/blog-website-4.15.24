            <h2>Orem, Utah</h2>
            <p>Orem, Utah, was undergoing significant development with numerous new apartment blocks. I was lucky to have found an apartment just outside the technical school I was attending. It wasn’t finished yet, so the realtor said I could live there until everything was completed. I stayed for about six months before I was told I had to start paying rent, but I refused because they hadn’t finished building the place yet. They threatened me with a lawsuit when I moved out, but I didn’t pay them anyway.</p>
    
            <h2>The Roommates</h2>
            <p>I moved in with a couple of bodybuilders, Steve and Jean. One of them was on steroids and was quite cranky most of the time, while the other was funny but perhaps mistrustful. I think I didn’t trust them because they were alcoholics, or maybe it was because they were from the mainland. As a person from Hawaii, I didn’t know how to trust people from the mainland. Heck, we had just met, so I’m sure anyone would have had the same type of reservations I did when meeting new people and not really knowing what to make of them.</p>
     
            <h2>The Cops</h2>
            <p>We lived in a three-bedroom apartment in the apartment block, and I remember one incident where I got so fed up with being trapped in that apartment. It was the night before final exams when the police were called because one of my roommates was playing music too loudly. The policeman knocked on the door. Steve said, “It’s the cops,” as he opened the door, then slammed it shut and locked it. The apartment was filled with ganja smoke; I now remember he was a heavy user, actually, both were. I didn’t smoke at the time. I only drank.</p>
   
            <h2>The Accident</h2>
            <p>So, I’ll go back to when I was living in my car in Waikiki because I was too embarrassed to live in my own hometown of Kaneohe due to an accident I had after an hour and a half surf session at Sandy Beach. We had left the beach park, and as we were driving out of that residential neighborhood, I was feeling a bit numb, as I’d always felt in my childhood years. But, as anyone knows who has surfed a place like Sandy’s, where the current is strong and so is the wind, an hour and a half surf session can really knock the energy out of you.</p>
   
            <h2>The Public Defender</h2>
            <p>There was no way I was going through with this case; that’s what was going through my mind. No way. I’ll kill myself. So, in a way, that incident was the end of one life and the beginning of another. I got a public defender, and he told me, “Thomas, you’re in a mess. You could have had a district exception and had this felony removed from your record as a young adult. But because you have 30 misdemeanors here on your rap sheet, you’ve lost that special chance. Now this here felony and all those misdemeanors are going to stick on your record and haunt you for the rest of your life. Here, as a citizen of the United States of America, you’re basically screwed." That’s the message I got.</p>
   
            <h2>Finishing College</h2>
            <p>But being a student didn’t come easy for me. I didn’t know how to learn. Sure, I went to school and almost graduated without having to take a GED. I shouldn’t say it was my school’s fault and blame my teachers, but I didn’t have any solid learning skills and I didn’t have the social skills to work with others so it was a very rough ride for my early adulthood years jumping from job to job from school to school from being on probation to being off probation and just lingering in that C average area rarely ever getting higher than a C for any subject.</p>
