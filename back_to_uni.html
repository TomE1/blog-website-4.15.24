                <h2>Back in Hawaii</h2>
                <p>I went back to Hawaii for Christmas one year from Utah and was relieved because it was so cold when I had left. When I got back to Orem, I felt I was a failure at being a student due to the lack of study skills. I began spending copious amounts of time in the school gym where I gained muscle mass and finally got to the point where I said, "I’ve had enough; I’m going back to Hawaii. I’m not learning much as a student here."</p>
          
                <h2>Back in Hawaii</h2>
                <p>I moved in with my grandmother who was staying on Makaloa Street in a studio apartment. I got a job at a hotel as a front office clerk, which was full-time and enrolled part-time in college. I rode my bike to school every day and to the hotel.</p>
          
                <h2>At Kapiolani Community College</h2>
                <p>At Kapiolani Community College, I finally started to learn the foundational skills I needed to be a student. The education was more at my speed.

I learned how to write, how to speak in public speaking, and other skills such as using computers and meeting deadlines. I also learned math and socialization skills. The foundational skills I learned there were invaluable and played an instrumental part in shaping my teaching career.</p>
      
                <h2>Working in Waikiki</h2>
                <p>Waikiki had many jobs for me because I was a bilingual speaker, and there were so many Japanese people there at the time. The economy was cranking, and I took service jobs. The front office clerk job lasted almost two years. I also worked at a 5-star hotel as a waiter in the Japanese restaurant. And in between that time, I worked as a travel agent and just picked people up in hotels and checked them in and sold them optional tours in hotels at the tour desk.</p>
     
                <h2>Working in Waikiki</h2>
                <p>My last job in Hawaii was at a clothing shop that was doing extremely well. I was getting $7000 commission checks every month and 200 checks every couple of weeks. I thought I hit the jackpot until the gears of tourism came to a halt. I think it was an earthquake in Japan that made people stop spending so much. There were a couple of economic crashes which told me it was time to pivot and move on, so I left and went on a two-year trip to
