    <p>I am a single unemployed American, 57 years old, currently in Cambodia, and I want to return to the United States, specifically Hawaii, because that’s the only place I am familiar with in America.</p>
    <p>I was born in Japan and lived there until I was three years old. My family then emigrated to Hawaii, which had become a part of the United States roughly 15 years before we moved there.</p>

   
    <p>I’ve spent more than 25 years in Asia. I first arrived in Thailand when I was about 32 years old, stayed there for about 20 years, then moved to Vietnam and lived there for about five years. I’ve also spent some time in Cambodia, where I am now. In about a week, I’ll be heading back to Vietnam because there’s a lot of short-term work there.</p>


    <p>I am an English teacher in Asia. That’s what I’ve been doing for the past 25 years or so. I can’t say that I love it, and I can’t say that I hate it, but what I can say is that I feel old—too old to be a teacher at my age.</p>
    <p>Most of my peers are in their 20s or 30s in Vietnam, but in Cambodia, it’s a little different; I notice that the teachers here are a bit older, maybe an average age in the mid-30s, and there are even teachers older than I am, which is why I chose to come here. However, it’s not a safe place for someone like me, a recovering alcoholic/drug addict.</p>

    <p>It has also come to my attention that I am an autistic, self-diagnosed. There have been a few professionals in my life who have implied that I have autistic characteristics, but I buried those feelings for a long time until they resurfaced a few days ago.</p>


    <p>I turned down a job in Cambodia. It was the best-paying job I’ve had yet in Asia, with pay at $26 to $32 an hour, and I was supposed to work 22 hours a week. I attended the induction and stayed the full 8 hours until the end of the day when we received our schedule.</p>
    <p>The writings in this book are designed to tell the story of me, to try to get to the truth, the core of what really happened. It’s a painful story of my life. As difficult as it may sound, I have to go through it; it’s part of my recovery process.</p>
